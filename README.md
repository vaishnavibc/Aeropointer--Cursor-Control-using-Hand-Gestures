# Aeropointer - Cursor Control using Hand Gestures

AeroPointer is an AI powered hand gesture recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe and PyAutoGUI that allows users to control their computer cursor through natural hand movements without the need for a physical mouse.

Using real time hand tracking, AeroPointer detects specific gestures to perform common mouse operations such as cursor movement, left/right click, scrolling, zooming  and dragging. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and human computer interaction, showcasing how gesture based interfaces can make digital control more intuitive and touchvfree.
